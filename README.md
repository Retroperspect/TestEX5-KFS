## intro
this is hte midterm assignment of the Test cause, which consist of 2 mandatory projects and 1 optional projects, which will be mandatory later down the road, so finishing it would be preferable.   

## project 1
the first project is testing out the `JavaANPR - Automatic
Number Plate Recognition System for Java` project, which is a program who's purpose is to scan pictures and read numberplates, and then pinpoint what is on the numberplate.   

### purpose of the test
the original test focuses on 2 test cases, one aim's to verify a single plate test works as intended, and another aims to verify all plates in a collection. Problem is from personal testing the single plate test is hard coded to test for one specific plate, and can't be applied to other cases, so a confirmation bias is present, and the second test works more dynamically and test all cases,

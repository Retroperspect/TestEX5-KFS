# LOG
>by kristian flejsborg SÃ¸rensen
## intro
it seems as though this assignment is best made while writing down logs doing project, as such this will stand as a log of my progress performing the various tasks.

so far it's been trouble dealing with the IDE, as my limited experience had me on a goose chase trying to figure out how to access this "maven terminal", after some work I managed to figure it out and run the tests succesfully!   
interesting to note, the IDE I use is `IntelliJ` and I seems to have the same access to "build and run" the tests as if I used the command `mvn surefire:test -Dtest=net.sf.javaanpr.test.RecognitionIT` only time will tell if I'm doing something wrong by using the quicker way.   
after succesfully running the tests with the logging code implemented, I find the amount of debugging information overwhelming and proceed to find the debug out from the `intelligenceSingleTest()` as the name suggest it being a much smaller sample size, granted it still spews out this.
```

This doesn't help me much other than saying it tries out a few different plates and attempts to compare templates of different plates with it atleast, I have yet to do the test with failure but I'll do that after this log post.   
looking into the different functions called in `intelligenceSingleTest()` it seems `CarSnapshot` and `Intelligence` are they only classes used in this function, and after the use of the string image to find what it needs, it seems the test itself is hardcoded to test for the value "LM025BD" as seen in the last assert `assertEquals("LM025BD", spz);` this must clearly mean that by changing the picture it uses in the test it breaks at this code excatly.

so yeah the previous statement about `assertEquals("LM025BD", spz);` was correct, it fails and as such the test can only test for one case.   
On the `testAllSnapshots()` it's different, it seems to identify if the info is correct or incorrect, however I noticed a assert that fails to work as intended.
```
 String snapName = snap.getName();
            String plateCorrect = properties.getProperty(snapName);
            assertNotNull(plateCorrect);
 ```
 in this area the assertNotNull will never work, specifically because the `.getName();` function states the following.

 `If the pathname's name sequence is empty, then the empty
     * string is returned.`
the string will always exist even if it's empty, therefor the assertNotNull will never catch that fact it's empty, if this is intended is unknown but it was interesting enough to write down about.

been bashing my head on the parametized tests, didn't have much experience with it yet Tine seems to say we've done some exercise on it, the only thing I could find was the slides with a short showcase and her Demo project on github, I may just be forgetfull but this wasn't helpful at all.   
After searching online for several examples I finally got the parametized testing to work, it seems like the test needed a constructor of all things, which I didn't catch in the beginning, so far my tests showcases 44 failures where it's not specifically red failures but yellow failures?.   
![](https://i.gyazo.com/cb299a39c74744505f16e663ba9be8f3.png)   
The difference seems to be yellow failures actually calls the functions and get to the point of comparing the info where it fails cause of missmatch, while the red hits a Null reference, which is wierd given the picture is there, so there's some code I'm unaware about as of this writing.
